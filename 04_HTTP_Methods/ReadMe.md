The HTTP_Methods.js simple example displays some of the basic methods from REST api, such as:

* GET for retrieving data from the server.
* POST to insert data to the server.
* DELETE to delete data from the server.

## Requirements

* Node 16.14.0
* Git

## Setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinD2308/test_nodejs.git
cd 04_HTTP_Methods
```

```bash
npm install
```

In order to insert or delete data from the server, a software called 'Postman' is needed. Data will be written in JSON format and the client can choose if the data will be inserted in the array or deleted from it.
