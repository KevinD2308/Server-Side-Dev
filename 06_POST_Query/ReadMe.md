The POST_Query.js example app is able to retrieve the data that the client sends. This data, unlike as in the previous example, is not shown in the URL.

## Requirements

* Node 16.14.0
* Git

## Setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinD2308/test_nodejs.git
cd 06_POST_Query
```

```bash
npm install
```

## How To Use

After starting the server, insert a JSON object using Postman. This object will then be displayed in the terminal.
