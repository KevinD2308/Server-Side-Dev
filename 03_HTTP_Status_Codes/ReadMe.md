The HTTP_Status_Codes.js example app illustrates some of the basic status codes for the HTTPS protocol, which are:

* 200 for successful requests.
* 204 for successful requests that do not provide any additional content.
* 404 for when the server has not found anything matching the Request-URL.

## Requirements

* Node 16.14.0
* Git

## Setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinD2308/test_nodejs.git
cd 03_HTTP_Status_Codes
```

```bash
npm install
```

Access the different URLs to then check the responses.
The status codes will be visible after accessing the developer tools and look at the network tab. The developer tools are accesible by pressing F12 on the keyboard.
