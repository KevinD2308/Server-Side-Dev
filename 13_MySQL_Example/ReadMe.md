The MySQL_Example.js example app illustrates how to work with a MySQL database via Express. Using this app, the client will be able to create a table that contains three rows: ID, Name and Grade. In that table the client can insert, delete or update data, as well as choosing to display specific or all data. This will be able using Postman.
